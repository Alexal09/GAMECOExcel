# GAMECOExcel

Analyze the past historical data of the regional gaming markets to foresee where the 2017 marketing budget should be allocated. 

GameCo executives are open to hearing any insights you can pull from the data but are specifically interested in these questions:

● Are certain types of games more popular than others?

● What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?

● Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?

● How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?
